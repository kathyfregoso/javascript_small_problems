/*
// UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
- INPUT: long string of text
- OUTPUT: string (sentiment analysis)
// There are X positive words in the text.
// Positive sentiments: [list of negative words]

// There are Y negative words in the text.
// Negative sentiments: [list of negative words]

// The sentiment of the text is [Negative / Positive / Neutral].

- RULES:
 - determine mood of input text
 - sentiment analysis: get subjective info from text and convert it to 
  concrete info
 - using lists of positive + negative words, analyze words to determine
  if the mood is positive, negative, or neutral

// EXAMPLES/EDGE CASES:
 - count includes REPEATS of words (die appears 2x)
 - count only includes EXACT MATCHES of words ('dreams' not counted for 'dream')

// DATA STRUCTURE(S): arrays, strings, integers

// ALGORITHM:
- split input text body into array of words (delimiter is space)
 - remove all punctuation!
 - replace \n with ' '
 - 
- iterate thru array
 - if current word element is in positiveWords array, push word to new array
 - if current word element is in negativeWords array, push word to new array
- compute sentiment score:
 - positive word count (array length) - negative word count (array length)
  -if count is > 0, return 
   - 'The sentiment of the text is Positive.'
  - if count < 0, return
   - 'The sentiment of the text is Negative.'
  - if count === 0, return
   - 'The sentiment of the text is Neutral.'
